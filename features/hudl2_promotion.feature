Feature: Sending a hudl2 promotion email
  As the email message transformation service
  I want to be able to send a hudl2 promotion email to a customer
  So that the customer can be notified that they have received promotional credit as a result of buying a hudl2

  Background:
    Given a "hudl2 welcome" email message is pending processing
    And it has the recipients:
      | type | name     | email                           |
      | to   | John Doe | blinkbox_test+johndoe@gmail.com |
    And it has the template variables:
      | salutation | John |
    And the sender is set to "tester <test@test.com>"
    And the ExactTarget header is set
    And the message id header is set

  Scenario: Generating an email from a template and provided variables
    When the message is processed
    Then an email is delivered to "blinkbox_test+johndoe@gmail.com"
    And it has the subject "You're ready to read with your Â£10 credit"
    And the html and text component matches the example output "hudl2_welcome"
    And it has the exact target headers
    And the sender is "tester <test@test.com>"
    And it has the message id header

  Scenario Outline: Receipt email generation fails when missing a required variable
    But I do not provide the template variable "<missing_variable>"
    When the message is processed
    Then I do not deliver an email to "blinkbox_test+johndoe@gmail.com"
    And the message is rejected

    Examples:
      | missing_variable      |
      | salutation            |
